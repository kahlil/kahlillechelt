  <p>Last year my manager quit. I was offered his position and since December or so, I am an engineering manager.</p>
<p>It is strange to move from a well-defined role into such a hazily-defined one.</p>
<p>A few things have changed. I don&rsquo;t code anymore at work and the relationship to my team has changed. Especially to those who now report to me.</p>
<p>I want to be the best possible manager to them that I can be, so I am busy learning.</p>
<p>My friend <a href="http://twitter.com/hglattergotz">Henning Glatter-GÃ¶tz</a> recommended the <a href="http://managingup.simplecast.com/"><strong>Managing Up podcast</strong></a> to me. I have listened to a bunch of episodes so far and it has been very helpful already.</p>
<p>If you are an engineering manager or are interested in becoming one, I highly recommend you check out <a href="http://managingup.simplecast.com/">Managing Up</a>.</p>
<p>So far, my favorite episodes are:</p>
<p><a href="https://managingup.simplecast.com/episodes/54705bed"><strong>Episode 5: One on Ones: The Basics</strong></a></p>
<p>I loved hearing about how they approach their one-on-ones and about their different techniques on how to ask questions. It was also really great to learn how commonplace one-on-ones are in engineering organizations.
One thing that surprised me was that it seems to be common to have weekly one-on-one meetings. We do it bi-weekly at LogMeIn. I think that it&rsquo;s a good frequency if the one-on-ones are not skipped.</p>
<p><a href="https://managingup.simplecast.com/episodes/creating-self-managing-teams"><strong>Episode 26: Creating Self-Managing Teams</strong></a></p>
<p>This episode really exposed the experience the co-hosts of the show have. They are very open about mistakes they have made in the past and discuss how you might achieve &ldquo;managing yourself out of a job&rdquo;. This is a phrase that I have been thinking about a lot myself and I feel that should definitely be an engineering managers goal.</p>
