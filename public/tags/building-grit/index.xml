      <description>When I started Grit I was excited to find out that the Electron team is shipping types with Electron which expose the Electron API in your tooling. Since I am a fan of TypeScript I set up my dev environment to write my code in TypeScript as well.
After a few days of writing TS code to transpile it for my app, I started to get annoyed with the fact that I am transpiling code.</description>

      <description>Static Site CMS is now Grit. I wanted to give it a name because I want to keep writing about building this thing and Static Site CMS is a shitty name.
Grit will be a Markdown editor for managing blog posts for your static site. There is nothing to see yet, I am still working on the MVP.
I&amp;rsquo;ll be writing a series of posts about the process of building Grit.</description>
