  <p>Product development has always been of huge interest to me. I love creating something with web technologies that solves a problem and iterating on it. That is basically what I do at work but I always wanted to have my own thing.</p>
<p>During the last year I have played around with a couple of ideas  while trying out different JavaScript frameworks. Altogether I think I must have at least started working on 4 or 5 things. Among those I made two small barely usable products: <a href="https://www.tinydraft.net">TinyDraft</a> and <a href="https://kaf.kahlillechelt.com">Kaf</a>. They are very simple and incomplete but they do implement a very minimal use case quite OK.</p>
<p>I always end up hitting a wall when it comes to adding a backend with database, authentication and authorization. Typically I would use services for that. But since I really just get to work on my personal stuff on the road during my commute I can&rsquo;t easily add any services. My connectivity is very limited during those train rides.</p>
<p>I also tried out using Hoodie which is great to work with locally but deploying a Hoodie backend wasn&rsquo;t trivial to me and ultimately I only really want to think about the frontend side and have the backend just work and be there in local development as well as in production.</p>
<p>So these products are going nowhere.</p>
<p>I realized in order to build and iterate on anything during my very limited free time I have to remove as much friction as possible. The solution to that problem came to me just a couple weeks ago.</p>
<p>Recently I hooked up <a href="https://www.netlifycms.org/">NetlifyCMS</a> to my site. It uses Netlify&rsquo;s auth service and GitHub to add posts to your site. If you set up automatic deployment via GitHub on Netlify that is a really great solution to adding posts to a static site through a nice UI.</p>
<p>But here I had the same problem. I write my stuff on the road and I can&rsquo;t rely on being online. But I really liked some of the functionality that NetlifyCMS provided, namely the scaffolding of posts, easy Front Matter editing as well as the automatic Git commit functionality.</p>
<p>I thought to myself: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s cool, I wish I had that for the desktop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the moment when it clicked! I could make this myself with Electron! I actually love working on Electron apps and I would be solving a problem for myself as well as removing my above-mentioned friction from app building. This type of Electron app can be developed without being online at all. Hooray!</p>
<p>I have started working on this over the holidays and I am developing it in the open, the code is <a href="https://github.com/kahlil/static-site-cms">on GitHub</a> and I will be posting about my progress here.</p>
<p>For now the product really does not have a name. The working title is Static Site CMS.</p>

<p>In my next post I will be writing about the setup I am using to build it.</p>
