  <p>Last week, I went to Paris to spend some time there with my family and to attend ReactEurope.</p>
<p>Based on the kind of mediocre design of their website I did not expect a lot of care to go into the organization of the conference. I expected a dull conference room in a hotel and some interesting talks.</p>
<p>I got some interesting talks and a dull, stuffy conference room in a dull, ugly area of Paris. The room was too small for so many people though. The air was terrible and people coughing and sneezing all around me. I was not capable of spending a lot of time in there.</p>
<p>Instead, I took some time to read through the <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html">React Hooks documentation</a>. Let me just take a second to say how well written and how thought-out the documentation is. Really world-class. Unlike the ReactEurope conference.</p>
<p>I also started rewriting <a href="https://github.com/kahlil/grit">my Grit editor</a> from <a href="https://github.com/preactjs/preact">Preact</a> and <a href="https://github.com/developit/htm">htm</a> to React with hooks. Just so to get familiar with them.</p>
<p>It is always hard to convey how features like that impact your development experience without trying it out. I have only rewritten a small part of it so far but I like it a lot.</p>
<p>The concept of custom hooks especially seems to have a lot of impact when it comes to simplifying your code.</p>
<p>Here is an example.</p>
<p>In order for Grit to work the user has to store the path to their Markdown files in the settings. I store the settings by using this ace package called electron-store by Sindre Sorhus (Shout out to him, what would I do without his stellar open source work?!).</p>
<p>This path needs to be shown in the UI via a state variable and it has to be synced back to the electron-store if it is changed.</p>
<p>So I created this custom hook called useElectronStore to read the path from electron-store and to set the filePath state variable from it and to set both, the state variable and electron-store, with the new value once it is changed.</p>
<p>And it makes getting and setting electron-store values incredibly easy. The API basically looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>const [someValue, setSomeValue] = useElectronStore('someValue', '');
</code></pre><p>The <code>'someValue'</code>-string is the path in electron-store and the second value is the default value for it.</p>
<p>I can now say that I &ldquo;get&rdquo; React Hooks because ReactEurope was not that great. Works for me.</p>
