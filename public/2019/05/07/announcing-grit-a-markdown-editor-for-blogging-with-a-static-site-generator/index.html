  <p>Last year I decided to write more. I thought I&rsquo;d try a hosted solution because I wanted to concentrate on the writing and not on the fiddling with the site.</p>
<p><a href="http://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a> was the most attractive solution to me but after using it for a while I realized that, as a developer, I am not capable of leaving the building of my blog to somebody else. There were too many things I wanted to tweak/change, bugs I couldn&rsquo;t live with etc.</p>
<p>So I ended up sticking with my <a href="http://gohugo.io">Hugo</a> solution.</p>
<p>Unfortunately there are many little annoyances when blogging with a static site generator, due to the fact that your posts are a bunch of Markdown files in a folder with a specific file name and some frontmatter boilerplate in them.</p>
<p>Creating a blog post was always tedious. Too many little fiddly things to do before you could just start to write.</p>
<p>In order to remedy this I created a <a href="https://github.com/kahlil/blog-cli">blog-cli</a> that just scaffolds new blog posts for me. It works fine but I really wanted an editor that can do that for me.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I built <a href="https://github.com/kahlil/grit">Grit</a>. It&rsquo;s a little Electron app that lets you manage a folder full of Markdown posts and edit them as well.</p>
<p>It allows you to store the path to your Markdown files, filter through the files, create a new file, edit the file and publish via Git.</p>
<p>I used <a href="https://preactjs.com/">Preact</a> and <a href="https://github.com/developit/htm">htm</a> to write it because I was too lazy to set up a build step and I love writing code the browser can directly interpret. For the file editing part in Grit I am using <a href="https://codemirror.net/">CodeMirror</a> which is a hell of a product, wow.</p>
<p>If you use Hugo, Jekyll, Gatsby or whatever other static site generator to build your blog and are looking for a little convenience there, give it a spin! See the current feature list <a href="https://github.com/kahlil/grit">on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an alpha version so there be dragons. But I am planning a bunch of improvements like: drag and drop images, configurable frontmatter and some enhancements around file-creation.</p>
<p>If you want, let me know what you think <a href="https://twitter.com/kahliltweets">on Twitter</a>.</p>
