title: "Chopping It Up With Henning"
---

We've been having a bit of a break on the Reactive Podcast. 
The break was involuntary and just caused by normal life stuff. 
_But_ we are working on getting back on track. Henning and I managed to 
put out a couple of episodes in which we chop it up about various things. 

The topics vary from what we're working on currently to other random stuff that shot through our heads while recording the podcast.

Check out [97: A Smoother-ish On-Boarding Process](http://reactive.audio/97) and [98: It's Tiring Too, But It's Good](http://reactive.audio/98) everywhere where you like to get your podcasts (unless its Spotify, we're not on Spotify).
