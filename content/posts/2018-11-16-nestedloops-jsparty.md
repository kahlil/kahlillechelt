title: "Nested Loops on the JS Party Podcast"
---

[Jan](https://twitter.com/thedeftone) and I had the distinct honor to guest on the JS Party podcast last week to talk about [Nested Loops](https://nestedloops.github.io). First of all it was a really great experience to be a guest on there. The Changelog family of podcasts are very professionally run and it was a great pleasure to be on. [@noopkat](https://twitter.com/noopkat), [@jerodsanto](https://twitter.com/jerodsanto) and [@adamstac](https://twitter.com/adamstac) made us feel very welcome and comfortable.

We talked about how Nested Loops was founded and immediately had band problems. Why I am rapping with a Jamaican accent. What [@bonotes](https://twitter.com/bonotes) role is. How the tech works and evolved on the music, video and effects sides. I think it came out great and you should definitely give it a listen.
