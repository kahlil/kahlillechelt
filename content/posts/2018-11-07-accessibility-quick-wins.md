We launched an [engineering blog at LogMeIn](https://medium.com/logmein-engineering). I contributed
[one of the first articles](https://medium.com/logmein-engineering/3-ways-to-quickly-add-accessibility-to-a-legacy-web-app-c3c92b51ef12)
in which I share some quick tips on how to boost accessibility on your legacy web app.

I always thought that accessibility on the web was super hard but I was surprised at how easy it can be. Yay for web
standards and WAI-ARIA ðŸ™Œ.
