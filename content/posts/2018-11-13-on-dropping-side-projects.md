title: 'On Dropping Side Projects'
---

I stopped working on my code-related side projects [grit](http://github.com/kahlil/grit),
[belly](http://github.com/kahlil/belly) and [flow-state](http://github.com/kahlil/flow-state). I have a family and we
recently moved. So most of my free time is spent working on the flat or spending time with the family.

There are a few side proj<ects I am not abandoning though.

- I will continue to co-organize [KarlsruheJS](http://karlsruhejs.org)
- Even though the podcast is on a break right now, we will continue with [Reactive Podcast](http://reactive.audio) soon
- I will continue to work on musical projects every now and then
- I will continue to write on this blog

Writing regularly is somewhat of a new habit for me. I always thought it was not for me, but I did feel an urge to write
that became bigger over the years. Now I'm just acting on it.

A big reason why I feel OK dropping my code related side projects is the fact that I feel quite happy and challenged at
work. I don't have to feed my desire to learn and grow with my side projects at the moment.

That's a pretty new and awesome feeling ðŸ˜€.
