title: "Nested Loops at the JSConf EU 2018 Opening Performance"
---

Once again [Boris](http://twitter.com/bonotes), [Jan](http://twitter.com/thedeftone) and me have been honored by the organizers of JSConf EU to participate in this year's opening performance of the conference as [NESTED LOOPS](https://nestedloops.github.io). That’s the name of the band we formed when we did the opening for the first time in [2015](http://youtu.be/lJ1kY-CSpBk).

Thank you for letting us do this. The result was quite epic if I may say so. I don’t think the video really does it justice. The screen was so huuuuuuge!
