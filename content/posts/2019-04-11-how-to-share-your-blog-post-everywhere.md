title: "How to share your blog posts everywhere, correctly"
draft: true

Last time I wrote about how you should publish under your own domain. I think that is really important but I also think that you should use other platforms to promote your writing. And use them **correctly**. 

When you do complete re-posts of your story it is best if the platform you are posting to supports the canonical-url metatag.

If you post an article under multiple URLs The canonical-url meta tag tells Google which one is the original. 

```
canonical-url="http://linktooriginal.com/the-article"
```
