title: "The Ultimate Recipe to Attract an Audience on the Internet"
---

My awesome co-worker [Emma Wedekind](https://mobile.twitter.com) wrote
[this post about how she got 27K followers on Twitter](https://dev.to/emmawedekind/how-i-gained-27000-twitter-followers-in-6-months-2hog).

It's a great post with lots of good advice to grow high quality followers.

I was able to watch the whole ride and it was quite something. There is one
thing I noticed about how she used Twitter that I think had significant
influence in why she blew up.

She **editorializes** her Twitter account. She deliberately tweets content that
might be valuable to the developer community. And she responds to tweets a lot.

She also keeps a very friendly, welcoming and helpful tone.

**Be kind and provide value frequently and consistently over long stretches of
time** is basically the ultimate recipe for attracting and growing an audience
on the internet. We've all seen this work many times.

It has happened many times over on YouTube, Twitter and of course many blogs.

The thing is, the hardest part is not to come up with the topics or to do the
writing itself. The hardest part is to keep it going in a specific rhythm over
long stretches of time.

It takes a lot of discipline to keep that up, it's hard work. But if you can do
it, it will pay off.

My hat goes off to Emma for doing it.

If you want an audience too, follow _the ultimate recipe_ and you most likely
will not blow up like Emma did, but you will for sure attract an audience that
cares about what you have to say.
