The biggest thing on my mind recently is the organization of our local
JavaScript meetup: KarlsruheJS. The next one is coming up next Thursday.

Usually I organized and planned them one after the other with the least effort
possible. Here in Karlsruhe we are so fortunate to have many companies in the
tech sector that are interested in hosting the meetup, so I really didn't have
to do much.

The meetup is running since about 7 years now and we made a little bit of a name
for ourselves. Typically we have 50-80 attendees.
