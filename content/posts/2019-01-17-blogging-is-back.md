title: "Blogging is Back"
---

I'm excited about blogs this year. It really feels like blogs and RSS feeds are
back. I am especially happy to see some developers getting serious about it.

[Dan Abramov](http://overreacted.io) started the year off with a barrage of
really good posts of which some already went viral. People even started to
translate them into different languages. Wow.

Yoshua Wuyts started the year with [a new blog](http://blog.yoshuawuyts.com) as
well. With a sick dark theme, too.

[CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com) relaunched their blog with an amazing dark
theme design. Not a new blog obviously but man did they make a splash with this.
[Their post about how they came up with the design](https://css-tricks.com/design-v17/)
is really impressive.
