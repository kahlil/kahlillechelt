title: "I am an engineering manager now"
---

Last year my manager quit. I was offered his position and since December or so, I am an engineering manager. 

It is strange to move from a well-defined role into such a hazily-defined one. 

A few things have changed. I don't code anymore at work and the relationship to my team has changed. Especially to those who now report to me. 

I want to be the best possible manager to them that I can be, so I am busy learning.

My friend [Henning Glatter-GÃ¶tz](http://twitter.com/hglattergotz) recommended the [**Managing Up podcast**](http://managingup.simplecast.com/) to me. I have listened to a bunch of episodes so far and it has been very helpful already. 

If you are an engineering manager or are interested in becoming one, I highly recommend you check out [Managing Up](http://managingup.simplecast.com/).

So far, my favorite episodes are:

[**Episode 5: One on Ones: The Basics**](https://managingup.simplecast.com/episodes/54705bed)  

I loved hearing about how they approach their one-on-ones and about their different techniques on how to ask questions. It was also really great to learn how commonplace one-on-ones are in engineering organizations. 
One thing that surprised me was that it seems to be common to have weekly one-on-one meetings. We do it bi-weekly at LogMeIn. I think that it's a good frequency if the one-on-ones are not skipped. 

[**Episode 26: Creating Self-Managing Teams**](https://managingup.simplecast.com/episodes/creating-self-managing-teams)

This episode really exposed the experience the co-hosts of the show have. They are very open about mistakes they have made in the past and discuss how you might achieve "managing yourself out of a job". This is a phrase that I have been thinking about a lot myself and I feel that should definitely be an engineering managers goal.
