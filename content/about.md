I am a JavaScript developer located close to Karlsruhe, Germany. I am currently working at LogMeIn in Karlsruhe as an Engineering Manager for GoToMeeting.

I am [@kahliltweets](https://mobile.twitter.com/kahliltweets) on Twitter but the best way to reach me is by sending an email to [kahlil@hey.com](mailto:kahlil@hey.com). Send me an email if you want to chat about JavaScript apps about Dancehall or if you are a JavaScript dev starting out and need some advice!

You can find all my open source code [on GitHub](https://github.com/kahlil).
