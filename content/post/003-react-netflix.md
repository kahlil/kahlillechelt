**[Netflix functions without client-side React, and it's a good thing &rarr;](https://jakearchibald.com/2017/netflix-and-react/)**

Jake Archibald on Netflix removing React from their landing page:

> Netflix has shown you could start with React on the server, then activate the client side parts if you need them, when you need them, and where you need them.

I hope this starts to become state of the art.
