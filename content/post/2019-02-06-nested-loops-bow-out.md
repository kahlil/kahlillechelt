title: "Nested Loops Bow-Out"
---

As you may know, I am a member of the JavaScript band
[Nested Loops](https://nestedloops.github.io/). We performed on the last three
opening performces of [JSConf.eu](http://jsconf.eu/).

We will not be performing at JSConf.eu this year.

It was a great honor and privilege for us to be able to do that and we are
thankful for the opportunity.

We produced original music for the conference and performed it in a browser. If
you want, you can re-live of our performances
[on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=jsconf+eu+nested+loops).
And you can listen to our story on the Changelog podcast
[here](https://changelog.com/jsparty/52).

I have no idea if we will ever perform again at JSConf.eu or any other event.

If you want to talk to us about performing at your JavaScript conference or any
other event, or if you needs some original music just
[drop me an email](mailto:hello@kahlil.info) or DM me on
[Twitter](https://mobile.twitter.com/kahliltweets).
