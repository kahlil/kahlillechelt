title: "Template Instantiation"

Happily stumbled upon this little video by [@dassurma](https://twitter.com/dassurma) and [@jaffathecake](https://twitter.com/jaffathecake). Apparently there is a template instantiation proposal out there somewhere that would add [lit-html](http://npmjs.com/lit-html) / [hyperHMTL](http://npmjs.com/hyperhtml) - like functionality to the template element. 

This would be huge if it made it into the platform. This would mean that Web Components would be complete because, [as I outlined before](https://www.kahlillechelt.com/post/2017/12/14/use-web-components-to-build-javascript-apps/), the only web standard missing for them to be useful out of the box is an API like lit-html that allows for their DOM to be rendered over and over again in an efficient way.

Here the (extremely short) video for your viewing pleasure:
