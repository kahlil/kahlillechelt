title: "Template Instantiation"

Happily stumbled upon this little video by @dassurma and @jaffathecake. Apparently there is a template instantiation proposal out there somewhere that would add `lit-html` / `hyperHMTL` - like functionality to the template element. 

This would be huge if it made it into the platform. This would mean efficient DOM updates would be baked into the DOM! WAAAAAAAHHHH! And it would also mean that Web Components would be complete because, IMHO, the only web standard missing for them to be useful out of the box in the browser is an API like lit-html that allows for the DOM to be rendered over and over again in an efficient way.

Here the (extremely short) video for your viewing pleasure:
