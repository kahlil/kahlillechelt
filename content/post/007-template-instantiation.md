title: "Template Instantiation"

Happily stumbled upon this little video by [@dassurma](https://twitter.com/dassurma) and [@jaffathecake](https://twitter.com/jaffathecake). Apparently there is a template instantiation proposal out there somewhere that would add `lit-html` / `hyperHMTL` - like functionality to the template element. 

This would be huge if it made it into the platform. This would mean that Web Components would be complete because, IMHO, the only web standard missing for them to be useful out of the box is an API like lit-html that allows for their DOM to be rendered over and over again in an efficient way.

Here the (extremely short) video for your viewing pleasure:
