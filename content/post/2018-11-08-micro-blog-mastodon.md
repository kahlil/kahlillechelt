Manton Reece [announced that Micro.blog supports Mastodon now](https://manton.org/2018/11/07/microblog-mastodon.html). 
This makes the two microblogging alternatives compatible with each other to some extend and effectively connects the two networks. I think this could be a really significant step for at least [Micro.blog](http://micro.blog). Congrats on the release @manton!
