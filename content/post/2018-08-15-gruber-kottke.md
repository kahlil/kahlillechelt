title: "Kottke At The Talk Show"
---

One of my favorite podcasts is [The Talk Show](https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/) with John Gruber. Gruber is the man behind [Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net/), a very successful and long standing Apple news and analysis website. 

The episode I would like to point out is the one on which Jason Kottke joined as a guest. John invited him to celebrate the 20th anniversary of [kottke.org](https://kottke.org/). 

I am not a big kottke.org reader but nevertheless I found his story and the history of the site very interesting. I am always fascinated with these type of project where one person runs a successful business by just relentlessly publishing on the internet in a very focused way. 

Check out The Talk Show episode in question [right here](https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2018/03/24/ep-217).
