Many designers and developers are taking the time, in various forms, to curate link-list-newsletters.

They contain 5-ish links in fat type with a low-contrast small-type link description below each link. 

Over time I have subscribed to many of those and although I appreciate the work that people put into them, they have lost their value to me. 

It's their sameness. I also don't know why the author has chosen those links. Did they actually read the content? Why do they think it is important?

I don't even know which is which anymore. I just see a link list, maybe read a couple link titles and am back to whatever I was doing. 

There is nothing that keeps me in the mail and it has become _work_ to figure out which link _could_ be interesting for me to check out. 

This is what I would like to see instead: 

Send an email with just one link. Write a paragraph about why you are sending out this link. Why does it excite/interest/enrage you?

Let me read your voice. 

I'd be thrilled to receive your newsletter and read it every time.
