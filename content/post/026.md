> This is Raquel's farewell episode. Sadly she is leaving the podcast as a co-host. But don't fret, she will join us every once-in-a-while to tell us about her adventures at Slack and quirky animals.

> Other than that your three fav co-hosts chop it up about what's going on at Slack right now, various conferences they are going to, social media nowadays, the only thing Facebook is actually good for and the arrival of the animal of the week at Slack planning meetings.

It is true. Raquel left the pod. It is sad. But at the same time it is an opportunity. Me and Henning will keep on going no matter what and we are on the search for a new co-host. Suggestions welcome.
