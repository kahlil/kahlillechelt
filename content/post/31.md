[Vanilla](https://matthewpalmer.net/vanilla/) is a menubar Mac app that allows you to hide menubar items. It's the first menubar icon management app that stuck with me. It is incredibly simple and just so cute!

When you launch it a little arrow and a dot appear in the menubar. You move the dot behind the last icon you want to hide and then click on the arrow. The arrow then swooshes over and lands on the spot where you put the dot with a nice little bouncy animation. 

Such a joy!
