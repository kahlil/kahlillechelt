title: "Grooming the Side Projects"
---

I stopped working on my code-related side-projects. I have a family and we recently moved. So most of my free time is spent working in the flat or spending time with the family. 

There are a few side-projects I am not abandoning though.

- I continue to co-organize KarlsruheJS
- Even though the podcast is on a break right now, I will continue with the Reactive Podcast soon
- I continue to write on this blog

Writing regularly is somewhat of a new habit for me. I always thought it was not for me but I always did feel an urge to write and now I am just acting on it.
