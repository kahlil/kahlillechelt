title: "Static Site Generators for Documentation"
---

We are using some internal libraries at work that are not very well documented. As a result it is really difficult and time-intensive to onboard onto the project. It became clear to me that not having good documentation can come at a very high cost when it comes to long-term productivity for a team with changing team members. 

As a result I started to work on documenting the inner workings of our application and it does feel satisfying to bring it to paper. 

With documentation on my mind I attended our local JavaScript meetup [KarlsruheJS](http://karlsruhejs.org/), which I also co-organize. Interestingly it featured a talk about [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) a static site generator based on VueJS which is specifically tailored towards creating documentation. I was smitten instantly!

[After tweeting about my excitement](https://twitter.com/kahliltweets/status/1057937401191059456) about VuePress KarlsruheJS member Carsten [directed my attention towards Docusaurus by Facebook](https://twitter.com/Jupiterrrr/status/1058267113138409472), which is (obviously) a React-based static site generator for documentation. And since [my co-worker Emma is totally into Gatsby](https://twitter.com/EmmaWedekind/status/1051767104108732416) I took a closer look there too and also found a Gatsby theme for documentation as well. 

My docs are not ready to be hosted yet but it is good to know that there are some solid ways to get a documentation site up quickly. Since our project is written in React I will not go with a Vue-based solution though. It will be either Docusaurus or Gatsby.
