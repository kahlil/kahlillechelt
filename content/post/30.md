title: "accesskey"
---

While working on improving accessibility features of an application I learned about an HTML feature that I was not aware of before: [the `accesskey` attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/accesskey).

The attribute allows you to add keyboard shortcuts to an element. 

In order to assign a keyboard shortcut you add the `accesskey` attribute to an element and assign it a letter. For instance the letter "a", like this:

```
<div accesskey="a"> ... </div>
```

This automatically binds a shortcut to the element that either focuses it or triggers a click event.

The actual shortcut varies between browsers and platforms but in general in modern browsers it is `alt` + `a` for Windows and Linux and `alt` + `ctrl` + `a` on the Mac and `alt` + `shift` + `a` on Windows and Linux on Firefox.
