Salary negotiations are difficult for most prospective employees. The Gods know that I always had my problems with it:

> What do I say when they ask me about my salary expectations? I want to earn significantly more than at my last job but I don't want to shoot too high and seem unreasonable or even endanger being hired right from the bat.

I always felt like salary and benefit negotiations during the hiring process are like a war between you and the company. They try to get you as cheap as possible and you try to get the best possible salary. 

I am filled with distrust towards the thing the hiring manager says about what they can or can't do.

Thankfully I got some really tremendous advice from a talent scout who matched me up with a really cool company at the time.

A [Twitter thread](https://mobile.twitter.com/filosottile/status/1070099435085066241) by [@FiloSottile](https://mobile.twitter.com/FiloSottile) that also links to [an article](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/) by [@patio11](https://mobile.twitter.com/patio11) reinforces and expands on that advice. This stuff is gold and will most likely make you a significant amount of money if you apply it. 

I recommend you read through the links above yourself but here is a summary of the points that were most important and helpful for me: 

First of all, if possible, create a reputation in your field that makes you a high value target for hiring. This is not mandatory but it is very useful because it creates leverage in your negotiation.

For me, running JavaScript meetups and being active on social media sharing knowledge definitely did the trick. There are many ways to do it but they always have something to do with being visible on the internet as an expert in your field.

Next, the most important thing: **never give a number first**. I found this one of the hardest things to actually do but my talent scout and also @patio11 have some nice language to get around that nicely.


Always negotiate. Everything said on the employers side is a negotiation tactic.

Never worry that an offer will be withdrawn if you negotiate, typically it doesn't happen.

Your compensation has nothing to do with how much you need, it's about your value at the company and your negotiation leverage. (Also the higher you are paid, the more you are respected and left alone, because your value is perceived higher).

Never give a number first! This is one of most important things I learned from that talent scout. He suggests that you just say: 

> First of all I would like to find out if this company is a good fit for me. When it comes to salary I am looking for something that is fair market.

@patio11 also stresses that point and has some similar strategies: 

> I’m more concerned at the moment with talking to you about discovering whether we’re a mutual fit.  If we’re a great fit, then I can be flexible on the numbers with you and you can be flexible on the numbers with me.  If we’re not a great fit, then the numbers are ultimately irrelevant, because your company only hires A players and I only work at roles I would be an A player at.

If they ask for your current salary, don't tell them. Politely refuse and say that your current salary is not important for this discussion. 

If you reveal how much you make now, they will most likely use that against you in the negotiation. 

Only start negotiating once it is clear the employer is ready to make an offer. At that point they already invested so much in you, that they will definitely want to come to a decision.

Research the company and repeat their words to them.

Establish reputation in your field. Have a hiring manager talk to you about a very specific role.
