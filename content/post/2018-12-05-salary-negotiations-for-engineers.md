Unfortunately, salary negotiations when starting a new job are like war. Each party is trying to get on higher ground to get the tactical advantage over the other.

Typically one of those parties comes to that fight ill-prepared. Of course that’s the prospective employee.

Here are the three most important things I learned:

## 1. Never give a number

If they want to know what you want to make, that want to gain leverage over you in order to lower your ask, don’t tell them. 

Rather tell them:

“First and foremost I am interested if we are a mutual fit. I am happy to talk about the financials later on in the process.”

If they keep asking say: “Money is not that important to me right now, I would like to find out if we are a mutual fit first. I do expect to be paid a salary that is fair market.”

If they want to know what you currently make, they want to gain leverage over you to see if they can low-ball you, don’t tell them.

Rather tell them:

“I don’t feel comfortable talking about the internals of my current working arrangement out of respect to my current employer.”

Or just be blunt and say: 

“I don’t see how my current salary factors into these discussions. Let’s find out if we are a mutual fit!”

## 2. Always Negotiate but 

You should always negotiate not necessarily because you need the money but because it represents your value at the company. It is a matter of respect and it influences how you are perceived at the company. 


## 3. Start Negotiating when you receive an offer

Since you are not giving them a number they will make an offer. Here is where you start negotiating. At this point it is highly unlikely that they would reject you for negotiating. They simply invested too much i to you already. Take your time, maybe say you have to take it over with your spouse. Or you need to read through it in peace.

Then, you can say that is not quite the number you had in mind.

To be honest it is a flaw in the system and really uncomfortable that one of your first interactions with your new employer is of this nature. 

There are rare cases in which it done differently. Basecamp for instance pays everybody the same competitive salary based on job title and current market situation. You should read their article about it, it’s such a refreshing take on this matter.
