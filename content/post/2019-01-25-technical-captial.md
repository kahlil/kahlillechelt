The Never-Ending Story of Leadership's Skepticism Towards Tech Debt Removal

Everywhere I have worked so far, I have met resistance towards tech debt removal
in some shape or from from some form of company leadership or some sort of upper
management.

First of all: what is technical debt exactly? Martin Fowler wrote a wonderful
definition for it.

> Like a financial debt, the technical debt incurs interest payments, which come
> in the form of the extra effort that we have to do in future development
> because of the quick and dirty design choice. We can choose to continue paying
> the interest, or we can pay down the principal by refactoring the quick and
> dirty design into the better design. Although it costs to pay down the
> principal, we gain by reduced interest payments in the future.

He also explains the oft-incurred consequences of technical debt:

> The all too common problem is that development organizations let their debt
> get out of control and spend most of their future development effort paying
> crippling interest payments.

– [Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TechnicalDebt.html)

> If the debt grows large enough, **eventually the company will spend more on
> servicing its debt than it invests in increasing the value of its other
> assets**.

The reasons why technical debt is accrued are always clear. Typically it has
something to do with achieving some business goal. I understand the friction
here, but what I don't understand is the fact that the understanding of why not
paying down your technical debt is detrimental to your business long-term seems
to be so hard to understand for some business leaders.

The above quotes say it best, if you don't pay down your debt you will be so
inundated in debt interest that productivity will effectively disappear and the
investment the company has to make into developing a single feature will be so
high, that it will not make any economical sense anymore. On top of that the
velocity of the teams will be so low, the competition will just come and eat
your lunch.

Under which circumstances can you make technical debt?

If you have the capabilities to pay it down. If you have the money in the bank
to pay it down -> the team has the capability to pay down tech debt.

# You Need Technical Currency to Pay Down Technical Debt

The financial metaphor is great for this and just like with finances, in which
there are times where you shouldn't take on any debt, the same goes for
technical debt.

As we all know, if you don't pay down your technical debt, the investment you
have to make in order to make changes or additions to the software get so high
that you either don't make any profit anymore or you become so slow that you are
easily disrupted.

You need technical currency in order to be able to pay down your technical debt.

What is technical currency? Here is how I would define it:

Technical currency is the teams ability to pay down technical debt. That ability
is the sum of

New outline:

What is technical debt?

...

You will always have reasons to make technical debt. Technical debt also accrues
over time. If you have a typical setup where your business depends on software
being maintained and further developed, it's not about not making technical debt
it's about keeping it at bay, keeping a balance.

You need to pay down technical debt in order to keep that balance. Otherwise
development will become so slow that the business either fails or is easilyx1
disrupted and then fails or at least gets much less profitable.

What do you actually need to be able to keep tech debt at bay? It's something
that I would like to call Technical Capital
