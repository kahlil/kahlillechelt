[Just](https://github.com/angus-c/just) is a collection of dependency-free modules for common operations 
on Arrays, Collections, Strings, Objects and Functions. 
"Do we really need something like that when we have Lodash?" you might ask.

Angus does a great job explaining why he started Just: 

> Just is designed for those who value easy to follow, debuggable utilities over version lotto and yak-shaving down the module tree. There’s nothing fancy or particularly clever here. You won’t find elaborate routines that optimize for trillion element arrays; just short, cohesive, readable code––the sort of helper functions we all inline in our projects every day because edge case optimizations that we’ll never need aren’t worth the overhead and the uncertainty of a sprawling dependency chain.
