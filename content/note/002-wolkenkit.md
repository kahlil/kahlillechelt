In this episode of the *German* podcast Working Draft [Golo Roden](http://twitter.com/goloroden) 
does a great job explaining what DDD (Domain-Driven Design), CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) and Event Sourcing is and how his new project [wolkenkit](http://wolkenkit.io) can help developers applying those principles and patterns.
